🚀 My First Experience with Game Development
During my Summer Semester in Year 2, I had the opportunity to explore game development for the first time. Using Eclipse IDE and Java, I built a memory game, which challenged players to match pairs of cards within a limited time. To make the game more engaging, I also implemented a hint system to assist players when they got stuck.

🕹 About the Game
This game was designed to test and improve memory skills. It included features such as:

🃏 Card matching mechanics – Flip cards and find matching pairs.

⏳ Timer-based gameplay – Challenge players to complete levels within a time limit.

💡 Hint system – Reveal a matching pair temporarily to help players.

🎨 Simple UI and animations – Smooth transitions for an engaging experience.

💡 What I Learned
Game logic and event handling: Implementing mouse events and game state management.

Working with Java and Swing: Designing UI components and handling game flow.

Hint system implementation: Managing temporary card reveals while maintaining game balance.

Debugging and optimizing performance: Improving gameplay mechanics and responsiveness.

🎯 Looking Back
This project was a turning point in my coding journey. It introduced me to game development concepts, making me more interested in UI/UX design and interactive applications. The addition of a hint system made the game more user-friendly and rewarding. Though it was my first attempt, it inspired me to continue exploring game programming in the future.
